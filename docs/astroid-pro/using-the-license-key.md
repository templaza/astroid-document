# Using the License Key

## About the License Key
Every Astroid license includes a unique 22 character key. This key is used to identify the subscription and is used by the Astroid Pro Updater and the Joomla Update Manager to allow access to add-on updates.

:::info[Note]
The key will become invalid when the subscription expires and valid again when a new or renewal subscription is purchased.
:::

The key can be found in the **Account** area in **Your Licenses** page, which you will be directed to after logging in, or by clicking on **Account** in the top right Menu

## Verify your domain name
Each **license** can only be used on a certain number of domains according to the **subscription package** you have purchased. Therefore, to be able to use the license key, you need to declare **your domain** on our website.

* In the license information section. Click on the "Domain Verified" button. You will see your domain list drop down.

* In the "Domain List" section. You enter your domain name in the domain field and click on the "Add Domain" button. These domains are plain domains without http or https.
