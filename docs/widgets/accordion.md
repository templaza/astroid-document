## 📦 Where Can You Use It?

### 🔄 1.1 Dynamic Content Settings (Optional)

Accordion Widget supports **Dynamic Content**, allowing each accordion item to load content automatically from other sources like Joomla articles, Joomla categories, or Joomla Users.

#### 🧠 What is Dynamic Content?
Instead of manually writing content for each item, you can link it to:
- A specific **article**
- A **category**
- Or Users source

#### ⚙️ How to Enable Dynamic Content
1. Under each Accordion Item, select **Advanced Settings** tab
2. Expand the **Dynamic Content Source** selection
3. Choose your desired **Dynamic Content Source**

#### 🔧 Available Dynamic Content Sources
- Joomla Articles
- Joomla Categories
- Joomla Users

#### 📌 Priority of Content
If **Dynamic Content** is enabled for an item, it will **override** the manually written content field.

#### 📝 Use Case Example
You want to display a list of tutorials from a Joomla category. Instead of writing each one manually:
- Click to **Dynamic** icon in each field
- The system will automatically pull and render the Joomla fields in the accordion item
- Select a **Joomla Field** as the dynamic source

> 💡 You can mix static and dynamic content — some items can have manually entered content, and others can pull from dynamic sources.
