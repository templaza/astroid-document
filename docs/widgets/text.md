### 1. **Heading**
- **What it does**: Shows a title above your text.
- **Example**: “About Us”, “Contact Information”
- You can choose what kind of heading it is: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.
- Customize the **font style** (font family, size, color).
- Add **margin** to give space around the heading.

### 2. **Content**
- **Where you write your main text.**
- It’s a rich text editor, so you can format the text, add links, images, etc.
- Example:
  > Welcome to our website. We provide the best services in town!

### 3. **Responsive Layout**
- This controls how wide your text area is on different screen sizes.
- Choose screen size: **Extra Large**, **Large**, **Medium**, **Small**, **Extra Small**
- Then choose how wide the text should be:
    - `1/2` = Half width
    - `1/3` = One third
    - `1/4`, `1/5`, `1/6`...

💡 *Tip: You can make text smaller on mobile and wider on desktop for a better layout.*

### 4. **Content Style**
- Choose font, size, spacing for the **content text** just like with the heading.

## 📋 Page Assignment

- Choose **where** this widget will appear:
    - All pages
    - No pages
    - Only selected pages (you pick from the menu)

## ✅ Example Use

Imagine you want a block on your homepage that says:

> **Welcome to Our Clinic**

With Text Widget, you can:
- Set "Welcome to Our Clinic" as a heading (`h2`, bold, large font)
- Write the rest in the content editor
- Set it to show only on the homepage
- Make sure it looks good on both desktop and phone

## 🛠️ Tips for Beginners

- If you don’t need a heading, just leave it blank.
- Use the **preview** to see how it will look.
- Use the **assignment settings** to control where it shows up.
